    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h2>Víctor Martínez</h2>
    
<p>My name is Victor Martinez (last name, with accent on the "i"). I was born in Venezuela but I'm currently living in São Paulo, Brazil. I'm married since December 11th, 2018 and sealed in the São Paulo Temple in December 20th with a beautiful woman from Venezuela too.</p>

<p>I work as a Bilingual Customer Service Analyst in a national company located in Barueri, São Paulo. I've been working with IT since I was 15 years old</p>

<p>When I was baptized  in 2016, I was called to serve as Young Men President, later on as Ward Clerk until 2021 when I was called to serve until today as the Second Counselor of thee Bishopric since October 2021.</p>

<p>I really enjoy watching films (Suspense, Sci-Fi, Action, horror and comedy movies a little), also TV series with my wife. When I'm not studying or working, I usually listen music (Rock, Oldies, Ballads, Pop and so forth), talk with my family in Venezuela or playing online games with my friend.</p>

<p>The first picture below, is my pretty and wonderful wife.<br>
The second one is a musical presentation of Encanto that the Relief Society and the Elder Quorum prepared for a stake activity in the church on September and of course, I was Bruno!<br>
The last one, Me and my wife in one of the most wonderful travels through the amazing state of São Paulo. This was in Holambra.</p>
